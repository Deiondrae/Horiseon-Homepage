"Horiseon" provided a codebase that was not up to accessibility standards that needed to be refactored. I organized html elements to follow semantic structure so that the code meets accessibility standards for the user and to make further refactoring easier. I ensured all the links were functioning correctly and also consolidated superfluous CSS selectors and properties. I included comments on both the html and css for easier navigation.
The images used all seem to be stock images and as such they were given blank alt attributes so that screen readers will skip over the content of the images.
